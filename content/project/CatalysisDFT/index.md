title: The Use Of DFT in Catalyst Development
summary: A paper for a course I did in catalyst development and characterization. The class was wholy untheoretical and utterly useless for any computational development. I scratched the itch by making this.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the role that catalysts play in chemical processes is essen-
tial for enhancing their efficiency, rate, and recyclability. Yet, there exists a notable challenge in
completely characterizing a reaction using experimental data alone. This challenge has spurred
the development of computational methods designed not only to replicate existing experimental
results but also to provide deeper insights that go beyond what can be achieved through purely
experimental means. Electronic structure theory and specifically density functional theory (DFT) aim
to achieve this through the characterization of potential energy surfaces. With access to the surface, a
computational chemist can run optimization procedures to discover energy minima and saddle points.
These points are paramount as they characterize the path chemical reactions take. This paper aims to
review the basic theory, catalytic applications, and an example calculation to give new chemists and
chemical engineers a resource to break into electronic structure theory.
