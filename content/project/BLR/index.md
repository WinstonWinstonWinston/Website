This document serves as a standard operating procedure (SOP) for performing
Bayesian linear regression (BLR). The goals of this document are as follows:
users will be familiar with the mathematics and theory behind BLR, users will
be able to implement a simple example of BLR in python, and users will be able
to take this knowledge and extended it to their own personal modeling situa-
tions. In order to use this document successfully users will need to be familiar
with gradients and their minimization properties from calculus III. Along with
this, a basic understanding of statistics is required. Users are expected to under-
stand the properties of normal distributions and be able to find their mean and
variance. Lastly a basic understanding of Python and specifically the packages
Numpy and Matplotlib
